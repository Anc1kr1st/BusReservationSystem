# Bus Reservation System
## Description

The functionality of this project is that the user can easily register by creating it’s username and </br>
password. After the successful registration, the user can easily login, but if there is no registration, </br>
then it will show an error while logging in. </br>

In this project, the user will enter the source and the destination where he/she wishes to go, </br>
and a list of buses going to that particular destination will be displayed. Once the list is </br>
displayed, the user can select any bus by entering the bus number, and its departure time will </br>
be displayed along with the destination. </br></br>

In this project, the user can book the tickets, and if the seats are not available, then it will </br>
display a message saying “Seat booking failed. The seat is already reserved or does not exist.” </br>
